# Tutorial Flow Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the complete tutorial flow for the Farpost lunar mining game, focusing on expected user behavior, modal sequencing, and step-by-step guidance for new players.

## Tutorial System Overview

### Environment Setup
When tutorial starts:
- Points set to minimum 1,000 for purchasing
- Extraction speed increased for faster tutorial experience
- Game state reset for clean tutorial environment

### Tutorial Persistence
The tutorial system maintains progress across browser sessions:
- **Page Reload Recovery**: If user refreshes the page during tutorial, they resume at their current step
- **Step State Preservation**: Current step number, completed actions, and tutorial environment are maintained
- **Modal Continuation**: After reload, the appropriate modal for the current step appears automatically
- **Highlight Restoration**: UI highlighting and blocking states are restored to match the current tutorial step
- **Progress Protection**: Users never lose tutorial progress due to accidental page refreshes
- **Clean Exit**: Once tutorial is completed or skipped, persistence is cleared for future fresh starts

### Expected Reload Behavior
- **During Modal Display**: Page reloads to show the same modal that was visible before reload
- **During Action Phase**: Page reloads to show highlights for the current step's required action
- **During Extraction Wait**: Page reloads to continue waiting for extraction completion with timer intact
- **Between Steps**: Page reloads to the transition state and continues to next step normally
