## 2. Core Systems

### 2.1 Resource System
| Resource | Expedition Cost | Mining Time | Base Value | XP Reward | Sale XP | Unlock Level | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------------|------------|-----------|---------|--------------|-------|
| Lunar Regolith | 20 | 30 min | 50 | 10 | 3 | 1 | Most abundant resource |
| Iron Ore | 30 | 1 hour | 100 | 15 | 5 | 1 | Basic construction material |
| Aluminum | 35 | 2 hours | 150 | 18 | 8 | 1 | Lightweight construction material |
| Water Ice | 40 | 4 hours | 200 | 20 | 10 | 1 | Essential for life support |
| Magnesium | 45 | 6 hours | 180 | 22 | 9 | 5 | Lightweight metal |
| Silicon | 50 | 8 hours | 250 | 25 | 13 | 5 | Electronics component |
| Titanium | 80 | 12 hours | 500 | 40 | 25 | 5 | High-strength material |
| Rare Earth Elements | 150 | 16 hours | 1500 | 75 | 75 | 10 | Advanced electronics |
| Platinum Group Metals | 200 | 20 hours | 2000 | 100 | 100 | 15 | Catalysts and electronics |
| Helium-3 | 300 | 24 hours | 5000 | 150 | 250 | 20 | Fusion fuel |

Resource Availability by Level:
1. Level 1 Resources (Quick Cycle)
   - Lunar Regolith: 30 min cycle
   - Iron Ore: 1 hour cycle
   - Aluminum: 2 hours cycle
   - Water Ice: 4 hours cycle

2. Level 5 Resources (Medium Cycle)
   - Magnesium: 6 hours cycle
   - Silicon: 8 hours cycle
   - Titanium: 12 hours cycle

3. Level 10 Resources (Long Cycle)
   - Rare Earth Elements: 16 hours cycle

4. Level 15 Resources (Extended Cycle)
   - Platinum Group Metals: 20 hours cycle

5. Level 20 Resources (Daily Cycle)
   - Helium-3: 24 hours cycle

Resource Properties:
- All resources have equal chance of being found in any cell
- Resource values scale with mining time and expedition cost
- Higher level resources provide better value-to-time ratio
- Each resource has specific use cases in the game economy
- Resources must be collected when mining cycle completes
- New expedition can be started after collection

Strategic Timing:
- Quick Cycle (30 min - 4 hours): Good for active players
- Medium Cycle (6-12 hours): Good for daily players
- Long Cycle (16-24 hours): Good for casual players
- Players should plan their check-ins based on mining cycles
- Multiple cells can be managed with different cycle times

#### XP Rewards System:
**Collection XP**: Earned when collecting completed resources from cells
- Fixed amount per resource type (see XP Reward column in resource table)
- Earned immediately upon resource collection

**Sale XP**: Earned when selling resources for points
- Fixed amount per resource type (see Sale XP column in resource table)  
- Calculated based on ~5% of resource value, rounded for balance
- Earned for each individual resource sold

**Booster Usage XP**: Earned when using any booster
- All boosters award 50 XP when used
- Earned immediately when booster is applied to a cell
- Applies to both speed boosters and Instant Extract

**Examples:**
- Collecting 1 Lunar Regolith: +10 XP
- Selling 1 Lunar Regolith: +3 XP  
- Using Basic Booster: +50 XP
- Total for complete Lunar Regolith cycle: 63 XP (10 + 3 + 50)

### 2.2 Booster System
| Booster | Cost | Duration | Speed Boost | Unlock Level | Applicable Resources |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Basic Booster | 100 | 1 hour | 2x | 1 | Level 1 resources |
| Advanced Booster | 250 | 1 hour | 3x | 5 | Level 5 resources |
| Elite Booster | 500 | 1 hour | 4x | 10 | Level 10 resources |
| Master Booster | 1000 | 1 hour | 5x | 15 | Level 15 resources |
| Ultimate Booster | 2000 | 1 hour | 10x | 20 | Level 20 resources |
| Instant Extract | Cannot be purchased | Single use | Instant | 1 | All resources |

#### Booster Application Mechanics

**Important: Boosters are applied PER-CELL, not globally!**

**Speed Boosters (Basic, Advanced, Elite, Master, Ultimate):**
1. **Purchase** booster from inventory using points
2. **Select** booster from deployment panel
3. **Apply to ongoing expedition** by clicking on a cell that is currently extracting
4. **Immediate effect** - extraction time is reduced based on booster multiplier
5. **Duration-based** - booster remains active for 1 hour from application
6. **Single use per expedition** - each booster application affects one extraction

**Instant Extract Booster:**
1. **Select** Instant Extract from deployment panel
2. **Click on extracting cell** (must be currently extracting)
3. **Immediate completion** - extraction finishes instantly
4. **Single use** - booster is consumed immediately

#### Booster Rules and Restrictions:
- **One active booster per cell**: Each cell can only have one active (non-expired) booster at a time
- **Multiple cells**: Players can apply boosters to multiple different cells simultaneously
- **Only for ongoing expeditions**: Speed boosters can only be applied to currently extracting cells
- **Cannot boost empty cells**: Speed boosters cannot be applied to empty cells for future expeditions
- **Cannot boost ready expeditions**: Speed boosters cannot be applied to completed extractions
- **Expired boosters can be replaced**: When a booster expires, a new one can be applied to the same cell
- **Tier restrictions**: Each booster can only boost resources of its tier or lower
- **Duration**: Speed boosters remain active for 1 hour from application time
- **Instant Extract exceptions**: Can be used on any extracting cell regardless of resource tier

#### Detailed Workflow Examples:

**Example 1 - Speed Booster on Running Expedition:**
```
1. Cell #5 is extracting Lunar Regolith (20 minutes remaining)
2. Player selects Basic Booster from panel
3. Player clicks on extracting Cell #5
4. Extraction time reduced: 20min ‚Üí 10min (2x speed bonus)
5. Cell #5 shows üöÄ "Basic Booster applied - 60m remaining"
6. Booster remains active for 1 hour
```

**Example 2 - Expired Booster Replacement:**
```
1. Cell #7 has expired Basic Booster during extraction
2. Player selects Advanced Booster from panel
3. Player clicks on extracting Cell #7 (expired booster is replaced)
4. Extraction time reduced further with 3x speed bonus
5. Cell #7 shows üöÄüöÄ "Advanced Booster applied - 60m remaining"
```

**Example 3 - Tier Restriction:**
```
1. Player tries to apply Basic Booster (Level 1 tier) to Cell #3 extracting Titanium (Level 5)
2. System shows: "Basic Booster cannot boost Titanium (tier too high)"
3. Booster is not consumed, player can try with appropriate tier booster
```

**Example 4 - Instant Extract:**
```
1. Cell #7 is extracting Helium-3 (24 hours remaining)
2. Player selects Instant Extract
3. Player clicks on Cell #7
4. Extraction completes immediately, resource ready for collection
5. Instant Extract is consumed
```

#### Speed Calculation Examples:
- Basic Booster (2x) on Lunar Regolith: 30min ‚Üí 15min
- Advanced Booster (3x) on Titanium: 12hours ‚Üí 4hours
- Elite Booster (4x) on Rare Earth Elements: 16hours ‚Üí 4hours
- Master Booster (5x) on Platinum Group Metals: 20hours ‚Üí 4hours
- Ultimate Booster (10x) on Helium-3: 24hours ‚Üí 2.4hours
- Instant Extract: Any extraction time ‚Üí Complete immediately

#### Strategic Considerations:
- **Mid-expedition boost**: Apply boosters to running expeditions to speed up completion
- **Resource tier matching**: Match booster tier to resource level for maximum efficiency
- **Multiple expeditions**: Use different boosters on different cells for parallel extraction
- **Timing**: Consider 1-hour expiration when planning booster usage
- **Emergency completion**: Use Instant Extract for urgent resource collection
- **Booster stacking**: Replace expired boosters on active extractions for continued speed bonus

#### UI and Visual Indicators:
**Cell States:**
- **Empty owned cell**: ‚ö° "Owned cell - Ready for expedition"
- **Boosted cell**: üöÄ "Basic Booster applied - 45m remaining"  
- **Extracting cell**: Resource symbol + timer "Iron Ore - Extracting..."
- **Ready cell**: Resource symbol + glow "Iron Ore - Ready to collect!"

**Booster Selection Flow:**
1. Click on booster in "Use Boosters" section
2. UI shows: "Selected Basic Booster. Click owned cells to apply booster for next expedition!"
3. Valid cells highlight, invalid cells grayed out
4. Click on valid cell to apply booster
5. Cell updates visual state, booster deducted from inventory

**Error Handling:**
- "Can only apply boosters to owned cells!" (clicked non-owned cell)
- "Can only apply boosters to ongoing expeditions! Start an expedition first." (clicked empty or ready cell)
- "Cell already has an active booster! Wait for it to expire." (clicked cell with active booster)
- "Basic Booster cannot boost Titanium (tier too high)" (tier mismatch)
